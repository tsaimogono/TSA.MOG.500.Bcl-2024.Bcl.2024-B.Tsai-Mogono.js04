**Challenge Scenario:** In this coding exercise, you will work with the Monster Ternary Operator. You'll use ternary operators to make decisions based on various scenarios involving Monster Energy drinks.

In each of these challenges, the ternary operator is used to decide between two options based on a condition, demonstrating its utility for concise conditional logic. Remember that while ternaries can make the code more succinct, they should be used judiciously to maintain readability, especially for more complex conditions.

## What You Need to Do:

1. Clone the provided Starter Code Repository to your local development environment (e.g., VSCode): https://github.com/CodeSpace-Academy/Module_4_StudentNo_Classcode_Group_Name-Surname_JSL04 
2. Open the cloned project in your code editor.
3. Code your solution for each of the challenges as per the provided instructions.
4. Commit your changes to your local Git repository with meaningful commit messages.
5. Push your local Git repository to your GitHub account.
6. Verify that the changes have been successfully pushed to your GitHub repository.

## What You Need to Include:

1. Ensure that your code includes the necessary modifications to meet the challenge requirements.
2. Your GitHub repository should contain the updated code files.

## How We'll Assess Your Work:

1. We will review your GitHub repository to ensure that it contains the updated code files.
2. We will assess the modifications made to the code to verify that they effectively meet the challenge requirements.
3. Successful completion of the project will involve implementing the ternary logic as per the provided instructions.
4. We will consider the commit history and meaningful commit messages to evaluate your coding process.

Please follow the provided steps and guidelines to complete the Monster Ternary Operator challenge effectively. Your ability to use ternary operators for conditional logic is a valuable skill, and we look forward to reviewing your work.

Monster Ternary Operator

Overview
This set of challenges demonstrates the utility of ternary operators for concise conditional logic in JavaScript. Ternary operators offer a compact way to decide between two options based on a condition. However, it's essential to use them judiciously to maintain readability, especially for more complex conditions.
   

## Setup

- Create a JavaScript file named `monsterTernary.js`.
- Copy the provided code into the file.
- Run the code in a Node.js environment, or open the HTML file in a web browser.

Challenge 1: Flavor Selection
Given a user's preferred type of Monster Energy drink, print whether they prefer a "Regular" or "Sugar-free" variety. If the preference is not set, default to "Regular".

Challenge 2: Stock Check
Given the number of Monster Energy cans left in the fridge, print "Time to restock!" if the number is less than 5, or "We're stocked!" if the number is 5 or more.

Challenge 3: Workout Intensity
Based on the current heart rate, determine if the user should drink a Monster Energy drink to boost their workout. If the heart rate is below 100 bpm, print "Boost needed!", otherwise, print "Energy levels are high!".

Challenge 4: Temperature Suitability
Determine if Monster Energy drinks are suitable for consumption based on the current temperature. Print "Chilled to perfection!" if the temperature is below or equal to 5°C, or "Needs a cooler!" if above 5°C.

Challenge 5: Late Night Coding Session
Determine if it's a good idea to have a Monster Energy drink based on the current hour. If it's between 7am and midnight (24-hour format), print "Unleash the beast!", otherwise, print "Better stick to water."

Conclusion
While ternary operators offer concise syntax for conditional logic, it's crucial to balance brevity with readability. Complex conditions or expressions can make code harder to understand, so use ternaries judiciously and prioritize clarity.
